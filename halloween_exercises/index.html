			<p>I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favourite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favourite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.<br /><br /> 
			If you click on the Personal link you can browse my favourite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p> 
			<!-- These contain the unordered lists. I embedded links to the words so that they will be clickable when shown on the webpage. -->
